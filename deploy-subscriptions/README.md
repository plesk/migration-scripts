This script creates subscriptions taking the domain name, system user login and password from a .csv file with delimiter ' ' (space).
After launching the script, it will ask for the IP address to assign to the subscriptions.

File example:

testsubscription1.local testsub1 Pa$$w0Rd1
testsubscription2.local testsub2 Pa$$w0Rd2
testsubscription3.local testsub3 Pa$$w0Rd3
testsubscription4.local testsub4 Pa$$w0Rd4
testsubscription5.local testsub5 Pa$$w0Rd5
testsubscription6.local testsub6 Pa$$w0Rd6

field1 - subscription domain name

field2 - system user login

field3 - system user password

How to use:
1. Prepare the .csv file according to example above.
2. Save it as cred.csv in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script, enter the IP address for the subscription and press Enter.
